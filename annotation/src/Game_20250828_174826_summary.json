While this could be seen as a genuine attempt to build trust, I wonder if Charlie's eagerness might be a subtle attempt to further their own agenda. After all, as Hitler, I know that Charlie is a fellow fascist, and their actions may be designed to manipulate the situation.\n\nHowever, I must be cautious not to reveal my own true nature. From my perspective, it's interesting to see how the other players are interacting with each other. Bob's comments seem rather generic, and David's suggestion to give us a chance to lead appears to be a genuine attempt to build trust. Eve, as the President, seems committed to enacting liberal policies, and I must continue to play along to avoid arousing suspicion.\n\nAs for who might be Hitler, I think it's still too early to tell. But if I had to speculate, I might say that Bob's lack of strong opinions or convictions could be a clever ruse.

Charlie, our current president, has already been revealed as a fascist, which doesn't come as a surprise given the recent fascist policy enacted. But who else might be hiding in the shadows?\n\nI've been watching Bob closely, and his sudden change in tone after the fascist policy was enacted raises some red flags. He seemed almost... defensive, as if he was trying to distance himself from the outcome. Could he be a fellow fascist, trying to cover his tracks? Or maybe he's just a liberal who's getting nervous about the direction of the game.\n\nAs for Hitler, I think Eve might be a strong candidate. She's been vocal about her concerns and has been pushing for a change in leadership, which could be a clever ruse to distract from her own true intentions. Her proposal to vote NEIN on the current government and consider a new team seems suspiciously convenient, almost as if she's trying to manipulate the situation to her advantage.\n\nBut, of course, this is all just speculation at this point.
