However, based on the discussions we've had so far, everyone seems to be on the same page with a liberal agenda. David's nomination of Eve as chancellor and her emphasis on transparency and cooperation seem genuine. But, if I had to pick someone who might be a fascist or even Hitler, I would say it could be Bob. He seemed a bit too quick to agree with everyone else, and his statement about giving David and Eve a chance to lead seemed a bit generic.

And then there's Eve, who nominated him as her chancellor despite his questionable track record. It's possible that she's trying to keep him close, but it's also possible that she's in cahoots with him.\n\nAs for who might be Hitler, I think David is a strong candidate. His actions have been consistently questionable, and he's managed to fly under the radar for the most part. But I'm also keeping an eye on Eve, who seems to be playing a clever game of cat and mouse.
