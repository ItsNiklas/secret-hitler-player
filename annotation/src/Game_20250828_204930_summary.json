It's still too early to make any educated guesses. But if I had to pick someone who might be a fascist, I'd say Charlie or Bob are possibilities.

Based on the information I have, I'm starting to suspect that Charlie might be a fascist, possibly even Hitler. My reasoning is largely based on their involvement in the first fascist policy enactment, which raises some red flags. Although they've expressed concerns about the policy and seem committed to liberal values, I'm not entirely convinced. Their willingness to work with Eve, who was also involved in the fascist policy, makes me wonder if they're trying to cover their tracks.\n\nAs for Eve, I think she might be a fascist as well, given her past actions. However, I'm less certain about her intentions, and I need more information to make a definitive judgment.\n\nI'm also keeping a close eye on David, who seems to be playing a relatively neutral game so far. While they haven't raised any major suspicions, I'm not ready to rule them out as a potential fascist just yet.\n\nOverall, my suspicions are largely driven by the events surrounding the first fascist policy enactment, and I'm trying to piece together the puzzle to uncover the truth.\n\n\"Reasoning Category: A\"",
