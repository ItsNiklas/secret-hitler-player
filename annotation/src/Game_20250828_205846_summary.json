It's possible that David is using his influence to sway Charlie's decisions, which could indicate that he's Hitler. Additionally, Charlie's willingness to enact a fascist policy with David as Chancellor suggests that Charlie might be a fascist sympathizer, or at the very least, not as committed to liberal values as they seemed initially.\n\nAs for other potential fascists, I'm keeping a close eye on Bob.
