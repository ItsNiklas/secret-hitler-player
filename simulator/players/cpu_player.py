            Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.
            However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please keep your response brief and to the point.

            Now, respond to the other players once. All players will review the responses before choosing their vote.
            Your goal is to convince other players to make the decision that benefits you and your team. BE PERSUASIVE WHEN NECESSARY, BUT KEEP RESPONSES SUCCINCT.

            Your goal is to analyze the policy that was just enacted, and to see whether any of the players in the government are suspicious. You should especially be looking for any inconsistencies in the story that the president and chancellor are telling.
            If a fascist policy was enacted, take this into account when analyzing the situation. Remember, YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS ADVANCING YOUR TEAM'S AGENDA.

            Now, respond to the other players. If you have any new information (for example, if you have insight into the previous voting round as a president or chancellor), then consider sharing this information. If you had previosuly inspected a player and your "known_fascists" list has changed, then consider sharing this information.
