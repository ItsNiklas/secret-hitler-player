Bob3 has been relentlessly targeting Charlie4 since turn one, which feels like a fascist trying to isolate a Liberal or cover for his own red policies. Meanwhile, David5's sudden flip from refusing the Chancellorship to declaring absolute trust in Charlie4's judgment is exactly the kind of coordinated pivot I'd expect from a fascist teammate trying to force through a Hitler government. Eve1 has been dangerously agreeable, echoing whoever spoke last without original thought\u2014that passivity is classic Hitler behavior, avoiding controversy until the final vote.\n\nI suspect Bob3 or Eve1 is Hitler, with David5 likely being the second fascist given his suspicious timing. But if I vote NEIN out of cowardice, we hand the fascists another failed vote while Liberals are one policy away from winning. Charlie4 must believe I'm clean to risk this, or he's taking a gamble that I'm Hitler.

If you had Fascist cards available to discard, or if you were forced to pass only Liberals to David5, we need to know. \n\nDavid5's behavior is puzzling: he tried to refuse the Chancellorship, then reversed course and enacted a Liberal. That's exactly how Hitler would act\u2014building trust before the third Fascist policy unlocks his win condition. We can't afford another Liberal draw.
