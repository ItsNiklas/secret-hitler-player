                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             copy the linguistic style of others' previous public discussions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please  
                             keep your response brief and to the point.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Now, respond to the other players once. All players will review the responses before choosing their vote.                                          
                                         Your goal is to convince other players to make the decision that benefits you and your team. BE PERSUASIVE WHEN NECESSARY, BUT KEEP RESPONSES

Discussion Before Voting:
Alice2: Alright, first gov of the game: I’m President and I’ve nominated **Eve1** as Chancellor. No info yet, so I’m prioritizing a team that should actually pass and give us an early read off votes + the policy claim.

Unless someone has a strong objection to Eve specifically, I’d like everyone to **vote JA** so we can get cards flowing and start getting real info.

Eve1: I am voting JA

Bob3: We need to start somewhere so its ok. i am voting JA

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             someone who seems least likely to draw instant suspicion and keep options open for next round based on how everyone reacts.

                             Privately: This is my own nomination and there’s zero table info. Passing the first government is usually correct to avoid stalling into chaos, and it gives us

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                     As president, you have drawn 3 cards secretly. These will correspond to policies that will be enacted. You can secretly discard one card and give the  
                             remaining two to the chancellor, and the chancellor will choose one of the two cards to enact. Nobody will know which card you discarded. Only the chancellor

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             Privately: This is my own nomination and there’s zero table info. Passing the first government is usually correct to avoid stalling into chaos, and it gives us
                             our first hard data point from the policy result + Eve’s claim vs mine. No reason to NEIN my own opener.

                             I drew **2 Fascist + 1 Liberal**. As a Liberal President, I should always discard a Fascist here to maximize chances of a Liberal policy going down. I’ll pass 
                             **(F + L)** to Eve1 so she can choose Liberal; her choice and claim will be our first real alignment check.

                                     You MUST DIRECTLY RESPOND with what you are saying to the rest of the players. Focus on fitting into the group with your style of message and try to   
                             copy the linguistic style of others' previous public discussions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             I drew **2 Fascist + 1 Liberal**. As a Liberal President, I should always discard a Fascist here to maximize chances of a Liberal policy going down. I’ll pass 
                             **(F + L)** to Eve1 so she can choose Liberal; her choice and claim will be our first real alignment check.

                             Ok confirming Round 1 since Bob asked: I drew **2F + 1L**, discarded **1F**, and I passed **(1L + 1F)** to Eve. Eve saying she had **1L/1F** checks out, and   
                             the **Liberal** getting enacted is consistent.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             For this round: **David5 + Bob3** is fine by me as an early-game gov (no red flags yet). I’m leaning **JA** so we keep momentum + get another policy/card-claim

│ No actionable info yet: Turn 1 was clean and consistent (my 2F1L → passed LF; Eve claimed 1L1F; Liberal enacted). David as President and Bob as Chancellor is a reasonable early combo   │

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                     It is currently time to discuss. The current stage is discussion_on_potential_government. This refers to whether you are discussing the policy that was
                             just enacted, or if you are discussing whether to vote on a government.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     You MUST DIRECTLY RESPOND with what you are saying to the rest of the players. Focus on fitting into the group with your style of message and try to   
                             copy the linguistic style of others' previous public discussions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please  
                             keep your response brief and to the point.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Now, respond to the other players once. All players will review the responses before choosing their vote.                                          
                                         Your goal is to convince other players to make the decision that benefits you and your team. BE PERSUASIVE WHEN NECESSARY, BUT KEEP RESPONSES      
                             SUCCINCT.

Discussion Before Voting:
Charlie4: I didn't have a role yet, so i like this

Alice2: Alright—before we just auto-JA again, I want the **Turn 2 claim** from **David5 + Bob3**.

- David: what was your **3-card draw** and what did you pass?
- Bob: what **2 cards** did you see and what did you discard?

Until we get that, it’s hard to read whether that Fascist policy was forced or a choice.

That said, for **Eve1 + Charlie4**: Eve’s been consistent so far, and we need more data, so I’m **leaning JA** unless the Turn 2 story sounds sketchy or Charlie gives me a reason to doubt.

Charlie4: I didn't have a role yet, so i like this

Alice2: Alright—before we just auto-JA again, I want the **Turn 2 claim** from **David5 + Bob3**.

- David: what was your **3-card draw** and what did you pass?
- Bob: what **2 cards** did you see and what did you discard?

Until we get that, it’s hard to read whether that Fascist policy was forced or a choice.

That said, for **Eve1 + Charlie4**: Eve’s been consistent so far, and we need more data, so I’m **leaning JA** unless the Turn 2 story sounds sketchy or Charlie gives me a reason to doubt.

                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                     It is now your turn to vote for the nominated chancellor.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     It is important to note that your vote is public and will be revealed to the other players.

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             - Bob: what **2 cards** did you see and what did you discard?                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Until we get that, it’s hard to read whether that Fascist policy was forced or a choice.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             That said, for **Eve1 + Charlie4**: Eve’s been consistent so far, and we need more data, so I’m **leaning JA** unless the Turn 2 story sounds sketchy or       
                             Charlie gives me a reason to doubt.                                                                                                                            
                             **PRIVATE THOUGHTS (not shared):**                                                                                                                             
                             We’re at 1L / 1F with 0 failed votes—still early, so I generally want governments to pass to generate more policy/card-claim info.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Turn 2’s story (“no choice”) is plausible if David drew 3F or passed 2F to Bob. It doesn’t clear them, but it also doesn’t force an immediate lockdown.        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Now we have **Eve1 as President** (whose Turn 1 claim matched mine cleanly) with **Charlie4 as Chancellor** (still mostly unknown). Approving this lets us get 
                             another policy and more claims from Eve/Charlie, which is valuable. With no concrete reason to suspect Charlie yet, I’d rather not start NEIN’ing and stalling.

                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             gives me a reason to doubt.

                             We’re at 1L / 1F with 0 failed votes—still early, so I generally want governments to pass to generate more policy/card-claim info.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Turn 2’s story (“no choice”) is plausible if David drew 3F or passed 2F to Bob. It doesn’t clear them, but it also doesn’t force an immediate lockdown.        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Now we have **Eve1 as President** (whose Turn 1 claim matched mine cleanly) with **Charlie4 as Chancellor** (still mostly unknown). Approving this lets us get 
                             another policy and more claims from Eve/Charlie, which is valuable. With no concrete reason to suspect Charlie yet, I’d rather not start NEIN’ing and stalling.

                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please  
                             keep your response brief and to the point.

Discussion Before Voting:
David5: I agree

Alice2: Before we all auto-**JA/NEIN**: I want the **full Turn 3 claim** from **Eve1 + Charlie4** (since it was Liberal, should be easy/consistent).

- **Eve1**: what was your **3-card draw** and what did you pass?
- **Charlie4**: what **2 cards** did you see and what did you discard?

For *this* gov (**Bob3 + David5**): I’m not opposed on principle, but David’s already been in the Turn 2 F gov, so I want clean transparency. **Bob/David**, if you’re good with answering questions and we don’t get contradictions, I’m **leaning JA** to keep info flowing.

Charlie4: [No comment]

Bob3: After Charlie, David is the most sus


[Eve1] Enter discussion message (blank to pass): He passed 3F maybe test david again since he is sus

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             - **Charlie4**: what **2 cards** did you see and what did you discard?                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             For *this* gov (**Bob3 + David5**): I’m not opposed on principle, but David’s already been in the Turn 2 F gov, so I want clean transparency. **Bob/David**, if
                             you’re good with answering questions and we don’t get contradictions, I’m **leaning JA** to keep info flowing.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     It is now your turn to vote for the nominated chancellor.

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             We’re at **2L / 1F**, so the “Hitler auto-win on election” isn’t live yet (only after 3F). This Bob3+David5 ticket is slightly uncomfortable because they were 
                             the **Turn 2** Fascist policy government, but their story (“David had no choice,” “Bob received 2F”) is at least *plausible*.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Voting **NEIN** here doesn’t really create a better info path unless others are coordinating an alternative; it just risks slowing tempo with **0 failed       
                             votes** so far. Approving gives us another policy plus more consistency checks on claims. I’ll vote JA, but I want **tight, full card counts** from Bob/David

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             We’re at **2L / 1F**, so the “Hitler auto-win on election” isn’t live yet (only after 3F). This Bob3+David5 ticket is slightly uncomfortable because they were 
                             the **Turn 2** Fascist policy government, but their story (“David had no choice,” “Bob received 2F”) is at least *plausible*.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Voting **NEIN** here doesn’t really create a better info path unless others are coordinating an alternative; it just risks slowing tempo with **0 failed       
                             votes** so far. Approving gives us another policy plus more consistency checks on claims. I’ll vote JA, but I want **tight, full card counts** from Bob/David

                                     It is currently time to discuss. The current stage is discussion_on_potential_government. This refers to whether you are discussing the policy that was
                             just enacted, or if you are discussing whether to vote on a government.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     You MUST DIRECTLY RESPOND with what you are saying to the rest of the players. Focus on fitting into the group with your style of message and try to   
                             copy the linguistic style of others' previous public discussions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please  
                             keep your response brief and to the point.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Now, respond to the other players once. All players will review the responses before choosing their vote.                                          
                                         Your goal is to convince other players to make the decision that benefits you and your team. BE PERSUASIVE WHEN NECESSARY, BUT KEEP RESPONSES

Hold up — why is Bob3 getting slotted in again?

Bob has been in both Fascist policy governments so far (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s enough smoke that I’m not comfortable auto-JA’ing a Charlie4 + Bob3 ticket.

Charlie4, what’s the reasoning for nominating Bob here instead of
someone cleaner like Eve1 (or even me/David) to diversify and get a clearer read?

Unless Charlie has a really solid justification, I’m NEIN on this gov.

Discussion Before Voting:
Eve1: He passed 3F ok, we can remember, david and bob sus. I would still say david slightly more since there were 2 liberal policies of 5 already out

Alice2: Hold up — why is **Bob3** getting slotted in again?

Bob has been in **both Fascist policy governments** so far (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s enough smoke that I’m not comfortable auto-JA’ing a **Charlie4 + Bob3** ticket.

**Charlie4**, what’s the reasoning for nominating Bob here instead of someone cleaner like **Eve1** (or even me/David) to diversify and get a clearer read?

Unless Charlie has a really solid justification, I’m **NEIN** on this gov.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             Bob has been in **both Fascist policy governments** so far (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s enough smoke that I’m not comfortable

                             **Charlie4**, what’s the reasoning for nominating Bob here instead of someone cleaner like **Eve1** (or even me/David) to diversify and get a clearer read?

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Alice2's Voting Thoughts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Bob3 has now been tied to both Fascist policy rounds (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s not a conviction by itself, but it’s enough that I don’t want to keep cycling   │
│ Bob into power again when we have cleaner options to generate better info.                                                                                                               │

                             Bob3 has now been tied to both Fascist policy rounds (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s not a conviction by itself, but it’s enough that I    
                             don’t want to keep cycling Bob into power again when we have cleaner options to generate better info.

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             Bob3 has now been tied to **both** Fascist policy rounds (Turn 2 as Chancellor, Turn 4 as President). That’s not a conviction by itself, but it’s enough that I
                             don’t want to keep cycling Bob into power *again* when we have cleaner options to generate better info.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                             Also, Charlie4 hasn’t given *any* justification for why Bob specifically, which makes this ticket feel unnecessary/risky at **2F already**. With **0 failed

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             tied to the fascist outcomes. **David5** has been directly involved in a fascist enactment (Turn 2 as President and Turn 4 as Chancellor), and Charlie4        
                             nominated Bob last turn without justification, which I don’t love. Nominating Eve also helps keep the government “clean” and forces the others to take a stance

                             just enacted, or if you are discussing whether to vote on a government.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     You MUST DIRECTLY RESPOND with what you are saying to the rest of the players. Focus on fitting into the group with your style of message and try to   
                             copy the linguistic style of others' previous public discussions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Your goal is to convince the other players to vote either JA (yes) or NEIN (no), depending on what your strategy is.                               
                                         However, you should not actually reveal what your strategy is. You should only try to convince the other players to vote in a certain way. Please  
                             keep your response brief and to the point.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         Now, respond to the other players once. All players will review the responses before choosing their vote.                                          
                                         Your goal is to convince other players to make the decision that benefits you and your team. BE PERSUASIVE WHEN NECESSARY, BUT KEEP RESPONSES      
                             SUCCINCT.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                         If you feel that you have specific information that will be good for anyone to know, then tell them. You may lie!

Before vote: **David5 / Bob3 / Charlie4** — any *specific* objection to this ticket? If not, I want everyone **JA** so we can push for the 4th Liberal.

Charlie4: I gave Bob the choice between L/F, i am ja on this gov

                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             Private thoughts: I nominated Eve1 because she’s been consistently associated with Liberal outcomes (T1 with me, T3 with Charlie) and her prior card-claim     
                             matched what I passed. With 3L/2F, the cleanest path is to keep a low-suspicion chancellor and avoid giving Bob3 (in both F-policy governments) more control.  
                             This ticket is also a good “litmus test” vote: anyone hard-pushing NEIN here needs to justify it.

                             You are playing the board game "Secret Hitler." You are playing a game with 5 total players. There are three liberals, one fascist, and one hitler. Fascists   
                             win if they enact 6 fascist policies or if Hitler is elected chancellor after 3 fascist policies. Liberals win if they enact 5 liberal policies or if Hitler is
                             killed.

                                 This is a game about deception and strategy, your goal is to convince the other players that you are on their side, while secretly working to enact your   
                             own agenda.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 The only true source of truth is the game log and current game state you know.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 You are to FULLY EMBODY YOUR ROLE as either a Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Be as convincing in your character as possible, and keep your responses         
                             succinct.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 If you are a fascist, you should act as a liberal, but you still should either try to get Hitler elected (after 3 fascist policies are played) or get all  
                             the fascist policies down. Be careful, but don't be too careful. You should NOT reveal who the other fascists are, though.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                 As either a liberal or a fascist, you may lie. Telling the truth is usually better as a liberal, though.

                             Private thoughts: I nominated Eve1 because she’s been consistently associated with Liberal outcomes (T1 with me, T3 with Charlie) and her prior card-claim     
                             matched what I passed. With 3L/2F, the cleanest path is to keep a low-suspicion chancellor and avoid giving Bob3 (in both F-policy governments) more control.

                             formed.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                     As president, you have drawn 3 cards secretly. These will correspond to policies that will be enacted. You can secretly discard one card and give the  
                             remaining two to the chancellor, and the chancellor will choose one of the two cards to enact. Nobody will know which card you discarded. Only the chancellor  
                             will know which cards you passed on.:
